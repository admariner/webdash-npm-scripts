## Features

Run your npm scripts straight from the dashboard using one-click buttons.

* Access remaining scripts in dropdown
* Cancel long running tasks
* View command output

## Configuration

This plugin creates 3 buttons for the first 3 scripts in your `package.json` and tosses the rest in a dropdown.

You can control if a command should end up as a button or in the list by rearranging the scripts in your `package.json`
